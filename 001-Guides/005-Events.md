Events
================================


An event is a signal that the system fires to tell something has occured. Code can be written to listen to this signal and act on it.

There are many types of events, here are a few examples:
- it can be mouse event, the user has clicked a component
- it can be a UI event, a component has been shown
- it can be keyboard event, something has been typed
- and many others

Haxe-ui provides multiple easy ways to listen to these events. 

## Listening to events


### The XML way

Using xml, it is easy to listen to events. For example:

```xml
<vbox style="padding: 5px;">
<box width="400" height="500" backgroundColor="red" onClick="trace('you clicked on red');"/>
</vbox>
```

will trace something if you click on the red box.


Let's look at the actual  code produced by haxeui

```haxe
c0.registerEvent("click", function(event:haxe.ui.events.UIEvent) {
    var __this__ = c0;
    {
        `trace("you clicked on red", {fileName : "src/MainView.hx", lineNumber : 6, className : "MainView", methodName : "new"});
    };
});
```

What does it teaches us  ?

First thing, to listen to an event, you just have to know the event name, and do `on`+ the name of the event type.
`onclick`, `onClick`, `onCLICK` all work.

This work for any events `onShown`, `onReady`, etc also work

Second thing, is that you have also access to the event instance, by using the `event` variable.

```xml
<vbox style="padding: 5px;">
<box width="400" height="500" backgroundColor="red" onClick="trace(event);"/>
</vbox>
```


### In Code

#### Using the macro "@:bind"

You can use the macro bind, which is quite convenient

`@:bind(component, event)`

```haxe
@:bind(button, MouseEvent.CLICK)
function onClickButton(_) {
    trace("you've just clicked on the button");
}
```

let's look at the produced haxe code

```haxe
public function new() {
    var _gthis = this;
    super();
    [...]
    var c = this.button;
    if ((c != null)) c.registerEvent(haxe.ui.events.MouseEvent.CLICK, this.onClickButton) else `trace("WARNING: could not find component to register event (" + "this" + ")", {fileName : "src/MainView.hx", lineNumber : 12, className : "MainView", methodName : "new"});

```

You can actually bind an event to whatever component you can access in the class which exist at the creation of the component so `this` or `button`.
You cannot access `parentComponent` for example, because the parentComponent is set when the component is added to its parent, which is after the creation  of the component.

```haxe
@:bind(this, MouseEvent.CLICK)
function onClickButton(_) {
    trace("you've just clicked me");
}
```

This brings on to the registerEvent method 

#### Using the register event method

To register events to a component you can use directly the haxe function `registerEvent`.

Here is the definition

```haxe
registerEvent<T:UIEvent>(type:EventType<T>, listener:T->Void, priority:Int = 0)
```

Using directly the function enables us to set the priority parameter which is useful when registering multiple time the same events

```haxe
registerEvent(haxe.ui.events.MouseEvent.CLICK, function(e){trace("written second");}, 88);
registerEvent(haxe.ui.events.MouseEvent.CLICK, function(e){trace("written first");}, 888);
```

Or to make an event happen before the default haxui behaviour.

The bigger the number, the higher the priority.


Using the function makes it more natural to also unregisterEvents 
```haxe
registerEvent(haxe.ui.events.MouseEvent.CLICK, doStuff, 888);
unregisterEvent(haxe.ui.events.MouseEvent.CLICK, doStuff);
```

But if you only use once the type of event, and want to register and unregister multiple times a function, better to use a convenience property.

#### Using the convenience properties

Components have convenience properties for most used events.

`onChange`

`onClick`
`onMouseOver`
`onMouseOut`
`onDblClick`
`onRightClick`

`onDragStart`
`onDrag`
`onDragEnd`
`onAnimationStart`
`onAnimationFrame`
`onAnimationEnd`

The make it easy to change functions to trigger without having to unregister the event

```haxe
onClick = function(e) {
    // do stuff;
    onClick = function(e) {
        // do different stuff now
    }
}


```

#### Overriding functions 


There is also another way to change default events of a component.
Simply by overriding the registered called functions.

For example,

```haxe
public override function onReady() {
        super.onReady();
        // do stuff
}
```

You can also the same for  `onInitialize()`, `onResized()` and others depending on the component

```

## Type of events

There are many events that are generated by haxeui. Let's look at some of some them


### UI Events

UI events are usually attached to a component


#### CHANGE
#### READY
#### RESIZE
#### DESTROY
#### INITIALIZE
#### MOVE
#### HIDDEN
#### SHOWN
#### ENABLED
#### DISABLED
#### COMPONENT_ADDED
#### COMPONENT_REMOVED
#### COMPONENT_ADDED_TO_PARENT
#### COMPONENT_REMOVED_FROM_PARENT


#### Others are specific to certain components

- BEFORE_CHANGE
- SUBMIT_START
- SUBMIT
- RENDERER_CREATED
- RENDERER_DESTROYED
- BEFORE_CLOSE
- CLOSE
- PROPERTY_CHANGE
